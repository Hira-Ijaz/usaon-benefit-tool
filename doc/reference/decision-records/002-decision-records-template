## Status
proposed

## Context
In beginning this decision record, having a common format for each entry would be helpful. @hazelshapiro 
did some research and proposed Nygard's format. 

## Decision
Use the template described by Michael Nygard's 2011 blog post - 
[Documenting Architecture Decisions] (https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
This format includes: 
- Title: short noun phrases
- Context: This section describes the forces at play. These forces are probably in tension and should be 
called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.
- Decision: This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with an active voice.
- Status A decision may be "proposed" if the project stakeholders haven't agreed with it yet, or "accepted" 
once it is agreed. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or 
"superseded" with a reference to its replacement.
- Consequences This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences 
should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and 
neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
(copied or summarized from the original blog post)

## Consequences 
@mfisher87 will review this proposal. Edit as needed and change the status to accepted once that is 
confirmed. All future decision record entries will follow the agreed-upon format
