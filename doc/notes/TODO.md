## Type checking

* The data models don't seem to be being type checked as expected. E.g. Passing the
  wrong field name doesn't trigger the type checker.


## Dependencies

* SQLAlchemy -> 2.0. NOTE: Remove the mypy plugin during migration!


## Templates

* Should Jinja templates have a `.html` or `.j2` extension?


## Terminology

* We use the term Registry and Library for what sounds to me to be the same
  meaning. What about picking one?
